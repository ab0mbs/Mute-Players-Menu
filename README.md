Mute-Players-Menu
=================

If you are using a custom scoreboard in Gmod 13 that does not have mute buttons for players, then this is for you. 

THIS IS INTENDED FOR SERVERS ONLY 

This is a simple menu that will display the players in the server, and allow you to mute them. 
The menu is activated by a chat command that can be changed via a ConVar. 
The menu also supports disabling muting of admins. This is also changeable via a ConVar. 
The chat command calls a console command of "LepMute" 

--ConVars-- 
"lmp_mute_admins" Default: "0" Desc: 0 = Admins CAN'T be muted. 1 = Admins CAN be muted 
"lmp_text_command" Default "mute" Desc: The value will be preceded by an ! The default value will end up as "!mute"
